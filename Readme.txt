Hello! Welcome to my spatial python tool for exploring land use regressions and visualizing principal component analyses (PCAs). I'd like to emphasize that this is an exploratory process, so while there are multiple functions in this tool, they are not neccessarily all meant to be run in order or at all. Instead, you should use these tools to visualize your data and determine multivariate regressions. 

When you open LUR.ipynb, you'll notice that the second cell is comprised entirely of functions. I also define these same functions within the code in examples of how to use the code, however if your using these functions on fresh data you should copy that second cell and utilize the functions as you see fit.
